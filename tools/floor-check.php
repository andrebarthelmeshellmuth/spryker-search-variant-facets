 * Verifies that this package's declared composer floors are REAL rather than guessed.

 * Run via `composer check-floors`, which first resolves every declared constraint down to its oldest
 * allowed version (`--prefer-lowest --prefer-stable --no-dev`) and then executes this script against
 * that tree. Any symbol `src/` references but which does not exist at those versions means a declared
 * floor is too low — the package would fatal on a shop that legitimately installed the versions we claim
 * to support.
 *
 * This exists because the original floors were derived from "whatever the development shop happened to
 * have, rounded down", which silently hid six entirely undeclared dependencies: the package worked only
 * because the development shop installed the full Spryker suite, and would have broken on any leaner
 * shop that ran a real `composer require`.
 *
 * Production dependencies only (`--no-dev`): dev tooling is irrelevant to what an adopter installs.
